					<h3>Popular Warcraft 3 mod Legion TD returns after 12 years with a standalone sequel.</h3>
					<p>
						The first time I laid eyes on Legion TD 2 was in 2016, when the developers launched a Kickstarter campaign
						to support its development. But its history goes back a lot further than that—all the way to Legion TD, a
						Warcraft 3 mod released in 2009. Development of the standalone successor began in 2014, Early Access followed the
						successful Kickstarter campaign, and on October 1 it finally went into full release on Steam.
